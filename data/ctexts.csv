Benin,"Benin’s public procurement system is structured around Law No. 2020-26 of September 29, 2020, which provides the legal foundation for acquiring public goods and services, including health commodities. Oversight is provided by the National Directorate for Public Procurement Control (DNCMP), the Departmental Delegations for Public Procurement Control (DDCMP), and the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (ARMP). In 2020, the government restructured its health commodity system by replacing CAME with SoBAPS S.A., expanding its mandate. Regulatory oversight is managed by ABREP through inspections and post-market surveillance. Health financing relies on government budgets, donor funding, and AM-ARCH, though sustainability remains uncertain. WAEMU MAPS regional frameworks also shape national procurement.","Benin’s procurement cycle is coordinated by the Ministry of Health, involving structured activities across several institutions. Need estimation uses PNDS and LMIS tools, but weak data systems hinder accuracy. Costing is managed through the Ministry of Health and ARCH scheme, though funding constraints reduce efficiency. Supplier selection is carried out by SoBAPS S.A. with ARMP oversight; limited planning and low procurement volumes affect bargaining power. Contract negotiation is conducted by SoBAPS under ARMP supervision. Purchase order creation faces frequent errors due to limited tracking systems. Reception of goods is handled by ABREP, though poor storage and training gaps affect stock management. Payment processing is supervised by the Ministry of Finance, but delays discourage supplier participation.","Benin’s procurement system faces administrative delays, financial misalignment, and limited operational capacity. Weak coordination between the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Finance contributes to inefficiencies. Human resource shortages and emergency procurement practices bypass standard procedures. These issues cause frequent stockouts, delayed treatments, and weakened market leverage.","Quality assurance is enforced by ABREP and ABMed through product testing, certification, and monitoring. Donor-supported systems such as WHO prequalification and batch testing complement national mechanisms. However, emergency procurement and limited regional QA infrastructure create risks. Stronger protocols and investment in regulatory systems are needed.",Benin has implemented several improvements including eLMIS/OpenLMIS pilots to improve stock visibility and reporting. Legal reforms under Law No. 2020-26 strengthened oversight and clarified emergency procurement. Donor-supported QA systems improved product integrity. Participatory budgeting initiatives have enhanced accountability and improved service delivery.
Guinea,"Guinea’s procurement system is grounded in the Code des Marchés Publics (Decree No. D/2012/128/PRG/SGG). The Ministry of Health leads sector policies, using a procurement manual for medical goods adopted in 2021.

Donor programs (e.g., World Bank) support procurement through electronic tools like STEP. Reforms aim to modernize PCG and increase domestic funding.","Guinea’s procurement cycle is jointly managed by the Ministry of Health and PCG SA. Need estimation uses facility-level data, though incomplete reporting limits accuracy. Costing is conducted with donor support but faces funding shortages and price volatility. Supplier selection is overseen by PCG SA with regulatory oversight; limited qualified suppliers and QA challenges persist. Contract negotiation faces delays and limited capacity. Purchase orders are managed by PCG SA but hampered by slow administrative processes. Goods reception is limited by storage capacity. Payment processing is delayed by currency fluctuations and weak financial controls.","Guinea faces bottlenecks including incomplete reporting, limited human resources, slow administrative procedures, and weak institutional coordination. Root causes include underfunding, donor reliance, and outdated systems. These issues lead to stockouts, delayed access to treatment, and reduced purchasing power.","Quality assurance is managed by PCG SA with Ministry of Health oversight. Inspection, supplier vetting, and post-market surveillance exist but suffer from infrastructure gaps and inadequate staffing. Donor-supported mechanisms (e.g., WHO prequalification) reduce risks, but emergency procurement still exposes vulnerabilities.","Guinea has implemented electronic inventory systems, standardized procurement procedures (2021 manual), and enhanced supplier accountability through donor partnerships. Modernization efforts of PCG aim to improve sustainability and transparency."
Niger,"Niger’s procurement is governed by Public Procurement Act No. 2011-37 and Decree No. 2016-641. ONPPC oversees importation, storage, and distribution through ONPPC-EPIC, LANSPEX, and SONIPHAR. DPHL/MT regulates medicines and oversees licensing. Donor-funded programs for HIV, malaria, and TB are integrated into the system. Persistent challenges include weak logistics systems, delayed reporting, and reliance on external partners.",Niger’s procurement cycle involves DPHL/MT and ONPPC with support from donor programs. Need estimation uses facility consumption data validated by disease programs. Forecasting suffers from inconsistent reporting and limited capacity. Costing is carried out by DPHL/MT and ONPPC using supplier quotes but suffers from delayed budget approval. Supplier selection evaluates quality and price but is hampered by a limited vendor pool. Contract negotiation suffers from legal ambiguities and limited negotiation skills. Purchase order creation faces communication gaps. Goods reception includes quality control by LANSPEX. Payment processing is affected by bureaucracy and currency risks.,"Niger faces bottlenecks including weak logistics infrastructure, reporting delays, and limited technical capacity. Root causes include fragmented coordination, outdated systems, and insufficient investment.
